/*
What i asked the AI to do: 
I asked the AI to create a write me a program that will ask the user for their first name.
then ask for their birthday in dd/mm/yyyy format. If they type the format wrong, it will 
let them know and ask them to retype it. Then it will ask for the first name of someone 
that’s close to them. followed by their birthday again making sure the formats the same. 
Then the program will take each letter of their name and find the number value example a=1 b=2 c=3 
and so on then add them all together as a variable. Then it will take the numbers from their 
birthday and add those together example 02/01/1991 will be 02 + 01 + 1991 then adds the sum 
to the sum of the sum of the name. The program will set that as a total. Then it will do the 
same thing with the other person’s name and birthday. It will then take the biggest total and 
subtract the other total to get the difference and store it as difference. it will then print 
"Your value is (total) " then print " The other persons value is ( Total ) " replacing total 
with their totals. Finally print “the closer the totals the closer the relationship is”."
